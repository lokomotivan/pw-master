# ProcessWire2.+ Admin Template Columns

This module adds two columns for use in your admin templates - sort of a sidebar for smaller fields if you like.

__Usage__

* Download and install the module above
* Add admin_column_left and admin_column_right fieldsets to your template and put the fields in the relevant column fieldsets
* (Optional) change the field width for either column, taking care to leave 1% for a gap between the two columns (default is left column at 70%, right column at 29%)

That's it!
